# Essential ES6 for React

## Arrow functions

An arrow function expression is shorter than a function expression.

```JavaScript
// function expression
function () { ... }

// arrow function expression
() => { ... }
```

But you have to be aware of its functionalities. One of them is a different behavior with the `this` object. A function expression always defines its own `this` object. Arrow function expressions still have the `this` object of the enclosing context. Don't get confused when using `this` in an arrow function.

There is another valuable fact about arrow functions regarding the parenthesis. You can remove the parenthesis when the function gets only one argument, but have to keep them when it gets multiple arguments.

```JavaScript
// allowed
item => { ... }

// allowed
(item) => { ... }

// not allowed
item, key => { ... }

// allowed
(item, key) => { ... }
```

However, let's have a look at the `map` function. You can write it more concisely with an ES6 arrow function.

```HTML
{ list.map(item =>
  <div key={item.objectID}>
    <span>
      <a href={item.url}>{item.title}</a>
    </span>
    <span>{item.author}</span>
    <span>{item.num_comments}</span>
    <span>{item.points}</span>
  </div>
)}
```

## ES6 Object Initializer

In JavaScript ES6 you can use a shorthand property syntax to initialize your objects more concise. Imagine the following object initialization:

```JavaScript
const name = 'Robin';

const user = {
  name: name,
};
```

When the property name in your object can be the same as your variable name, you can do the following:

```JavaScript
const name = 'Robin';

const user = {
  name,
};
```

In your application you can do the same. The list variable name and the state property name share the same name.

```JavaScript
// ES5
this.state = {
  list: list,
};

// ES6
this.state = {
  list,
};
```

Another neat helper are shorthand method names. In ES6 you can initialize methods in an object more concise.

```JavaScript
// ES5
var userService = {
  getUserName: function (user) {
    return user.firstname + ' ' + user.lastname;
  },
};

// ES6
const userService = {
  getUserName(user) {
    return user.firstname + ' ' + user.lastname;
  },
};
```

Last but not least, you are allowed to use computed property names in ES6.

```JavaScript
// ES5
var user = {
  name: 'Robin',
};

// ES6
const key = 'name';
const user = {
  [key]: 'Robin',
};
```

Computed property names might make no sense yet. Why should you need it? In a future chapter in the book you will come to a point where you can use it.

## ES6 Destructuring

There is a way in ES6 to access properties in objects and arrays easily. It's called destructuring. Compare the following snippet in JavaScript ES5 and ES6.

```JavaScript
const user = {
  firstname: 'Robin',
  lastname: 'Wieruch',
};

// ES5
var firstname = user.firstname;
var lastname = user.lastname;

// ES6
const { firstname, lastname } = user;

console.log(firstname + ' ' + lastname);
// output: Robin Wieruch
```

While you have to add an extra line each time you want to access an object property in ES5, you can do it in one line in ES6. Additionally you don't have to have duplicated property names. A best practice for readability is to use multilines when you destructure an object into multiple properties.

```JavaScript
const {
  firstname,
  lastname
} = user;
```

The same goes for arrays. You can destructure them too, but keep it more readable with multilines.

```JavaScript
const users = ['Robin', 'Andrew', 'Dan'];
const [
  userOne,
  userTwo,
  userThree
] = users;

console.log(userOne, userTwo, userThree);
// output: Robin Andrew Dan
```

Perhaps you have noticed that the state in the App component can get destructured the same way. You can shorten the filter and map line of code.

```JavaScript
  render() {
    const { searchTerm, list } = this.state;
    return (
      <div className="App">
        ...
        { list.filter(isSearched(searchTerm)).map(item =>
          ...
        )}
      </div>
    );
```

You can do it the ES5 or ES6 way:

```JavaScript
// ES5
var searchTerm = this.state.searchTerm;
var list = this.state.list;

// ES6
const { searchTerm, list } = this.state;
```
